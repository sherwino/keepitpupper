# Keep It Pupper

[keepitpupper.com](//keepitpupper.com)

## A petite homepage for the best music lounge in the internet:

## the **Puppy Lounge**

The Puppy Lounge is a music channel on [JQBX.fm](//jqbx.fm), a Spotify app that makes listening to music a social thing. The app lets you play music, vote whether you like a song, chat, and create playlist in a group/social setting. The Puppy Lounge is one of about twenty of the most active rooms on the site, and we felt that it would be nice to make a little page for it.

## The Site

Plan to keep the site really lean, try my best to avoid all of those front-end libraries, and MVC frameworks for something this simple. Just going to keep it to JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Now to keep it interesting I am going to list a few tools I would like to use to make it interesting.

- Firebase Realtime DB
- Hosting using Firebase CLI
- Service Workers
- Src Set Image Swaping
- Create a Map Widget, with Pupper information

### Useful Information

To keep track of what I am doing I am going to make a little readme for each of the technologies used, and things I should note for future projects.
